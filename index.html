            <img src="images/profile.pic.jpeg" alt="DJ Patrias" class="profile-pic">
            <p>Hi, I'm DJ Patras, a passionate technology enthusiast born and raised in the vibrant city of Las Vegas, Nevada. 
                Growing up, I always had a natural curiosity for how things work, especially in the world of gaming and tech. 
                Im a lifelong fan of Dragon Ball Z and love diving into challenging games in my free time. Although I wish I had 
                started my journey into coding earlier, Im thrilled to now be immersing myself in web development, where every line 
                of code feels like a step into an exciting new adventure. Im constantly learning and pushing myself to master new skills, 
                and I cant wait to see where this path will take me next!</p>
